# Smart Panda

Smart panda is a simple tetris engine intended (but not limited) to be used as a
dev environment for Artificial Intelligences. For more information (and a live demo)
checkout [my personal page](http://h3nnn4n.me/post/smart-panda/).

Please note that this is my first attempt at doing anything serious with rust and wasm.
Also I never used webpack before. So expect some nasty things in this repo. If you are
learning (just like I am), this repository may have some bad practices, so beware.
As I learn more I should make things more tidy around here.

## Features

1. A cool (or silly) name
2. Implemented in rust ðŸ¦€
3. Compiles to [WASM](https://webassembly.org/)
4. Has a JavaScript interface
5. Runs in the browser
6. ???
7. Live demo?
